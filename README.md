# CVS - Secp256k1 Partial Implementation

## Pre-requiste
Kindly see the go.mod file to check the dependencies for running this file

## Overview
This is a practical use of secp256k1 for generating keys, signing them and then authenticating the keys. I used ecies's secp256k1 for generating keys and then I used those the generated keys for signing and verifying a text message.

### Note
Kindly note this was an experimental use case and most part of the code has been taken from various libraries for pkg.go.dev . If you need anything kindly contact me anytime(email: anas.azam40@gmail.com) and I'll get back you asap.
